# Quizzera
Quizzera helps Teachers to create the quizzes, customize the marks and can add skill tags along with questions and students to take quizzes.

# Functionalities:
1)	Create Quiz: This functionality is provided to “Teacher” where they can create the quiz, customize the marks and can add skill tags along with questions for eg “critical thinking”,”Problem solving” etc which will be later visible to students and give students a glimpse of their strong and weak points.
	
2)	Get Student Marks: This option is available to teachers where they can see the marks of their students (of all classes 1st - 8th ) for their respective subject.

3)	Take Quiz: This functionality is available for students. When they click on the dropdown, their respective class is fetched and from the backend all the subjects whose quizzes are available for that particular class will be visible. When a student selects a subject, next they will be asked about the type of quiz and its passcode. Then they will be headed over to the quiz. After the quiz,  students will see their marks, incorrect questions and detailed analysis based on the skill tags.
